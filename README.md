<!-- ABOUT THE TASK -->
## About 
This PHP simple task was actually assigned to me as an assignment, where I had to reveal my way of thinking and find the most simple, fast, and clear solutions. 

### Built With
* [php](https://www.php.net) <br/>
This code is a pure PHP code.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This task included two files, the first file basically included a Sort Function, that should sort numbers from low to high in an array, with no use for any built-in (Sort Functions). Where I had to use a Quick Sort algorithm and take the (sizeof) to move between the array elements. On the other hand, the second file needed extra effort in creating a function that determines whether a string is a valid hex code. Where I had to declare a variable of an array that includes the valid characters in a hex code, and then exclude other unacceptable characters based on the If statement to revet a boolean output.
